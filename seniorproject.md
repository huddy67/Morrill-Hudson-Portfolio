8-28 - Laser cut personal box to hold materials

9-1 - Begun the wood pen project

9-3 - Glued wood pen pieces togeher and waited for them to dry until the next day

9-5 - We drilled a hole through the two wooden pieces that we glued together and then put the metal shaft in the hole with super glue

9-8 - Sanded down the sides of the pen and then started to turn it

9-10 - Finished turning the pen 

9-12 - I assembled the pen and made sure that everything worked

9-18 - I wanted to do the pearl project but still was deciding

9-24-25 - I tried to decide what I am doing for my project. I am considering doing the Pearl ,project but am not sure because of football

9-25-25 - I decided that I was not doing the pearl project and started to think of other ideas I could do

9-26 - I had an idea to do a wooden scoreboard that updates live games, specifically the Carolina ,Panthers so you can see the score in real time on the board

9-29 - I did research on my project, figuring out things I would need to make it work. I used the link below for comparing the Raspberry Pi models and seeing which one worked best for the projectct https://socialcompare.com/en/comparison/raspberrypi-models-comparison

9-30 - I researched what type of wood I would need. The link for the wood I am thinking of using is below https://www.amazon.com/Walnut-Hardwood-Unfinished-Woodworking-Engraving/dp/B0BGJPDKC9/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.gUsOiHq67dtfxt1U_VQ4dTYEUkbNh_famtHiYpJ5QpqRtA450h0VsWHSnaWjj0zqvM7zEEwvhbwYppn6R_9OvC--dLu8DRhQ26Y-jhZQoUUdOIvVgbapU-lnD4R4os2WCAcf_VSNgXVwKYJkVH6Vr2obWF4-sm0zrIJ99PERhLIfu_FNWLlYVxMhvm_kSW-xF-tJoaxWwSjV8v9V_MJ5snNNw2XJ7ShlCgHCYGeMDCIL6M1moYHb_DjMOYRo7pv_cgMampEofQqZKQ6uHCzUT98-5MhG8X5-98tjNxbW7VA.Dcw0PzxSFJHqbMRiCVxZK1h3RdOviEKmLT9FpwL4a7o&dib_tag=se&keywords=walnut+wood&qid=1760012287&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1

10-1 - I did more research on my project to try and figure out how I would make it work. To get live data, I needed to use an API. Most of them are paid for, but I found an ESPN one that should work. If this does not work, then I may need to find another solution. https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/football/nfl/scoreboard

10-2 - I found more materials like these LED strips that will light up the engraved panthers logo https://www.superlightingled.com/side-emitting-4mm-ultra-thin-led-neon-flex-strip-lights-p-6099.html

10-3 - I created a Google Doc that helps me and my teacher visualize my idea and see any potential errors https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nw5ylel2ZrbF-HW83ZcTL0ofzCo5Q5WhvYyqAbZ7k_Q/edit?tab=t.0

10-6 - I found more pieces like this led light module below which will help me display the score of the game https://www.amazon.com/EC-Buying-MAX7219-Electronic-Components/dp/B0BXDJS22V/ref=zg_bs_g_306759011_d_sccl_3/139-5931038-1637611?th=1 or https://www.amazon.com/uxcell-Cathode-Segment-Display-Digital/dp/B07GTQWF4R/ref=zg_bs_g_306759011_d_sccl_2/139-5931038-1637611?th=1 or https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-Digital-Segment-Display-Arduino/dp/B01DKISMXK/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1WDQOB053FNZK&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Np0RE7e9EVySouEVPqbavddCHAgqzqR3dO0dPpNf7-f7-6RpaLmcr3cG_zv0TgJlyAj4dtKT-_eYC5HFY5TcJkD1th9UX-K6PcksFYs0TV49oD95dAhoJoFOL-YkqKOI2TAWU5D1s2PfgrRPRfjgo1X1djVEaPNbdCTHrZYi7ii3KoPjiE8kcgRZIWMU8PQQY9NPFeEIfQKYrLOiLFRNfjctv4Yfl8nji9CJJDM4C7T_LGYziRJDJhXgNsdJ2LBPxlL24Jc6C1Kl__bhguirUt1j3do_XCt_UaBI5hCqv6Y.jSnkcrvbavJX5rROSa5QzcNYsbus0bBEislMH5VtWo0&dib_tag=se&keywords=led%2Bdigit%2Bmodule%2B2%2Bdigits&qid=1760014000&s=industrial&sprefix=led%2Bdigit%2Bmodule%2B2%2Bdigits%2Cindustrial%2C67&sr=1-3&th=1

10-7 - I worked through some of the fundamentals of the project and how I would get it to work. I realized I needed a Raspberry Pi with a wifi module so it could connect to the live scores that I would program it to receive and display.

10-8 - I looked over the laser cutting workflow to make sure I knew how to use it

10-9 - I added more things to the Google Doc that I linked for 10-6 to give me a better idea of how I would do my project

10-10 - I finished the spreadsheet with all of my materials and included the ones that we may have at the fabla,b like wiring, sandpaper, wood varnish, resin, etc... https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1inqLF94JXjDDkbQPFtxw10qv6yk3-GvXojiwrM2xEpA/edit?gid=0#gid=0

10-13 - I worked on 3d printing and laser cutting. I printed a snake, and then while it was printing reviewed my project for any missing materials.
