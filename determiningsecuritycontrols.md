# Determining Security Controls for Devices

### Project overview

In this project, the main objective was to learn how we can properly secure our data, as well as identify when our data or information my be at risk

### Objectives

- Learn the CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
- Identify vulnerabilites that hackers could take advantage of
- Understand how to defend your device from vulnerabilities
- Check to see if software was updated and installed, and if not then either update or install it to prevent vulnerabilites from being exploited
- know common tactics that hackers may use to access your data and information

### Guided Notes: Cybersecurity Basics for Devices

We took notes on a google doc where we learned about the CIA triad, common device vulnerabilities, common ports, and types of phishing attacks. 

CIA Triad

Confidentiality
- encryption 
agreements
The only thing that can decode data is an encryption key (ssh).
 Keeps information secret from people who shouldn't see it
Websites could have security breaches

Integrity
- Keeping information/data uncorrupted, accurate, and trustworthy
- data has not been tampered with on purpose or by accident

Availability
- Making sure that information and systems are available when we need them
EX. College board making sure servers are up while people are taking exams

Common Device Vulnerabilities:

- A weakness that can be exploited
  - Ex. outdated operating systems
    - Companies release updates to fix weaknesses
  - Ex. unencrypted data
  - Ex. weak passwords
  - Ex. open ports

- Place where software can connect to the internet
  - Like a “window” or “door” that lets services communicate (can be inspected)
  - Some ports are necessary; closing unused ports is like locking doors so strangers can't come in

- Well-known ports (standardized by IANA)
  - `80`   — HTTP  — hypertext transfer protocol (unencrypted web)
  - `443`  — HTTPS — secure web traffic (HTTP over TLS)
  - `22`   — SSH   — secure shell (remote command line)
  - `25`   — SMTP  — simple mail transfer protocol (sending mail)
  - `110`  — POP3  — retrieve mail (downloads & removes)
  - `143`  — IMAP  — mail on server (syncing)
  - `3389` — RDP   — remote desktop protocol (Windows GUI access)
  - `53`   — DNS   — domain name system (name → IP resolution)

- Unpatched software
  - Definition: applications or OS versions missing vendor patches that fix security flaws
  - Ex. Windows updates (Patch Tuesday)
  - Ex. Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
  - Ex. Mobile apps on iPhone/Android
  - Ex. Ubuntu/Linux packages and kernels

- Checklist
  - Identify and update outdated OS and applications
  - Close or firewall unused ports
  - Enforce strong, unique passwords and MFA
  - Ensure encryption for data in transit and at rest
  - Schedule regular patching and vulnerability scans


#### Matching Cards Activity

We started off by doing an activity where we were given two sets of cards, one set being orange and the other being green. The green cards would have an example of someone doing something that puts their data at risk, and the orange cards would have a solution to making sure that their data is not at risk. Me and Scarlett were partners for this activity and our pictures of our card matches are below.
