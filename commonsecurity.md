### Which device inside a LAN would be the easiest for an attacker to compromise, and why?

I would say that the devices that are the easiest to compromise would be things like smartphones, printers, thermostats, etc... because these devices often have default passwords that are easy for attackers to guess. Also, these devices are most likely to have open ports exposed to the network which makes them easy to attack.




Does proximity equal safety? How much can a device ‘see’ inside a LAN?
