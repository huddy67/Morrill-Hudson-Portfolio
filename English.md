### WRITER’S BIO
I am a senior with a strong interest in business, problem-solving, and building ideas from the ground up. I have always enjoyed working on projects that combine creativity with practical thinking. In seventh grade, I started my first small business by building a portable ice cream stand out of plywood and selling ice cream in my neighborhood. What began as a simple project quickly taught me important lessons about planning, customer experience, and responsibility. That experience sparked my interest in entrepreneurship and shaped the way I approach projects today.

Since then, I have continued to explore business-related ideas and hands-on projects, often focusing on how systems work and how they can be improved. I enjoy taking initiative, whether that means designing something physical, organizing a plan, or finding better ways to execute an idea. Balancing schoolwork with these interests has helped me develop skills in time management, adaptability, and critical thinking.

Alongside my interest in business, this course helped me grow in an area I did not expect to enjoy as much: writing and film analysis. Over the semester, I became more comfortable analyzing how stories change when adapted from books to movies. I learned how directors use film techniques such as camera angles, pacing, and tone to shape the audience’s experience. Writing about these choices challenged me to think more deeply and explain my ideas clearly instead of relying on summary.

Looking ahead, I plan to major in business in college. I applied to Clemson, Virginia Tech, Tennessee, Auburn, and Penn State, and I am excited to continue developing skills that combine creativity, leadership, and analytical thinking. This class strengthened my confidence as a writer and helped me appreciate storytelling in both written and visual forms.

## TAB 1: WRITER’S STATEMENT
At the beginning of the semester, I viewed writing mainly as an academic requirement rather than a tool for thinking. As the course progressed, I began to see writing as a way to organize my ideas and clearly explain how books and films communicate meaning differently.

One of the biggest improvements in my writing was learning to move beyond summary. Earlier assignments focused too much on retelling the story instead of analyzing how and why certain choices were made. Writing the Wiseguy and Goodfellas essay helped me understand how techniques such as voiceover, editing, and point of view influence how the audience views a character. I learned to support my ideas with specific examples and explain why those details mattered.

Revision also became more meaningful throughout the semester. Instead of only correcting grammar, I worked on restructuring paragraphs, clarifying arguments, and improving flow. This process helped me become more confident in my writing and more willing to rethink my ideas rather than settling for a first draft.

This class also changed how I watch movies. I now pay closer attention to camera movement, lighting, tone, and acting choices. Studying films like Goodfellas showed me how directors intentionally guide the audience’s emotions and perspective.

Comparing The Princess Bride in both book and film form helped me understand that adaptation requires creative decision-making. Some elements work better on the page, while others are more effective on screen. Overall, this course helped me grow as a writer and a more thoughtful viewer, skills that will be useful beyond this class.

### PROJECT OF CHOICE SUPPORTING PARAGRAPH
For my final project, I worked with Raaj and Daniel to create a podcast analyzing the differences between a book and its film adaptation. Our goal was to discuss how the film interpreted the original text and evaluate which elements worked better on screen than on the page. Through this project, we explored how changes in structure, tone, and character portrayal affected the overall meaning of the story. The podcast allowed us to apply concepts from the course in a collaborative and creative way.
