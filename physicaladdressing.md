# Exploring a Network Interface Card (NIC)

Every MAC address belongs to a piece of physical hardware called a Network Interface Card (NIC). Even virtual machines use virtual NICs that operate the same way.  
In this activity, you will examine a NIC, label its features, and identify where the MAC address is located.

## 1. Observing the NIC Images
Study Image A and Image B and note the following:
- Ethernet port on a metal bracket
- Green circuit board
- Several chips and components
- Gold connector edge (PCIe connector)

Your goal is to understand the major physical features of a NIC.

## 2. Labeling the NIC
Label these components:

1. **Ethernet Port (RJ-45 Port)**  
   Where the network cable plugs in.

2. **PCIe Connector (Gold Edge)**  
   Fits into the motherboard; provides power and data transfer.

3. **Main Controller Chip**  
   The “brain” of the NIC that sends and receives frames.

4. **MAC Address Sticker**  
   Usually located on the metal bracket or near the port.

### Tasks for Image A
- Draw an arrow to the Ethernet port and label it.
- Draw an arrow to the PCIe connector and label it.
- Draw an arrow to the main controller chip and label it.

### Task for Image B
- Draw an arrow to the MAC address label and label it.
- Record the MAC address exactly as printed:  
  **04:92:22:64:IA:80:4C**
- Write one sentence explaining what a MAC address does on a local network.  
  A MAC address uniquely identifies a network interface on a local network so Ethernet frames can be delivered to the correct device at Layer 2.

## 3. Add to Your Digital Portfolio
Write one sentence each explaining:
- **What the Ethernet port is used for**  
  The Ethernet port is the physical connection on the NIC where a network cable plugs in to allow wired network communication.
- **What the PCIe connector is used for**  
  The PCIe connector allows the NIC to connect to the motherboard so it can receive power and exchange data with the computer.
- **Why the NIC needs a main chip**  
  The main controller chip is needed to process incoming and outgoing data and control how information is sent across the network.
- **Why the MAC address belongs to the NIC**  
  The MAC address belongs to the NIC because it is permanently assigned to that hardware to identify it on a local network.

### Reflection Prompt
“Why is a MAC address considered a physical address, and how does seeing a real NIC help you understand this?”  
Write 2–3 sentences.  
A MAC address is considered a physical address because it is permanently tied to the hardware that sends and receives Ethernet data. Seeing a real NIC makes it easier to understand that addressing starts at actual physical components. This shows how hardware identification is required before higher-level network communication can happen.

## Part B — Interpreting Your MAC Address

Now you will retrieve your MAC address from your Ubuntu VM and interpret it using the OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier).

### 1. Retrieve Your MAC Address
Use the same command from the earlier lesson to find your MAC address.  
Example:

Record your own MAC address.  
**92:e1:0d:6f:d4:91**

### 2. Identify the OUI
The first three pairs of the MAC address are the OUI.

Example:
- Full MAC: 52:54:00:ab:cd:ef
- OUI: 52:54:00

Write down:
- Your full MAC address: **92:e1:0d:6f:d4:91**
- Your OUI: **92:e1:0d**

### 3. Look Up Your OUI
Use:
- https://maclookup.app/

Record:
- Vendor/manufacturer
- Whether it appears physical or virtual
- Any notes provided

#### Notes About Virtual OUIs
- Virtualization vendors (QEMU, VMware, VirtualBox, Hyper-V, etc.) use reserved MAC ranges.
- Some lookup tools may show:
  - “No results found”
  - “IEEE Registration Authority”
  - Only the OUI block, not the company

This is normal.

### 4. Compare Physical vs Virtual MAC Addresses
Write 4–5 sentences explaining:
1. Where the MAC address appears on a physical NIC
2. Where your VM’s MAC address came from
3. What physical and virtual MACs have in common
4. What is different
5. Why a virtual NIC still requires a MAC address

On a physical NIC, the MAC address is stored in the card’s firmware and is often printed on a label attached to the hardware. In a virtual machine, the MAC address is assigned by the hypervisor using a predefined range. Both physical and virtual MAC addresses follow the same format and serve the same purpose at Layer 2. The main difference is that physical MAC addresses are tied to hardware manufacturers, while virtual MAC addresses are generated by software. A virtual NIC still needs a MAC address so switches and network protocols can correctly deliver frames.

## MAC Address OUI Lookup Activity

Look up the OUIs of seven real-world MAC addresses using:
- https://maclookup.app
- https://macvendors.com
- https://standards-oui.ieee.org/oui/oui.txt

For each MAC address, record:
- Full MAC address
- OUI
- Vendor/company
- Vendor type (physical, virtual, both)
- Notes

### Digital Portfolio Table

| Full MAC Address | OUI (first 3 pairs) | Vendor / Company Name | Vendor Type | Notes |
|------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------|-------|
| F0:18:98:AA:BB:CC | F0:18:98 | Hewlett Packard Enterprise | Physical | Commonly found in enterprise servers and switches. |
| 3C:5A:B4:11:22:33 | 3C:5A:B4 | Apple, Inc. | Physical | Seen in Mac computers and mobile devices. |
| 60:45:BD:12:34:56 | 60:45:BD | Samsung Electronics | Physical | Used in smartphones, TVs, and other consumer devices. |
| A4:BA:DB:22:33:44 | A4:BA:DB | Amazon Technologies | Virtual/Cloud | Often associated with cloud instances in AWS. |
| 04:1A:04:55:66:77 | 04:1A:04 | Cisco Systems | Physical | Found in enterprise routers and switches. |
| 00:50:56:AA:BB:CC | 00:50:56 | VMware, Inc. | Virtual | Standard prefix for VMware virtual NICs. |
| 52:54:00:12:34:56 | 52:54:00 | QEMU / KVM | Virtual | Reserved OUI commonly used for KVM/QEMU guests. |

### Reflection (3–4 Sentences)
Address:
- Patterns noticed in vendors
- Why virtualization vendors need registered OUIs
- How this activity improved your understanding of Layer 2 addressing

The table shows that physical MAC addresses are usually tied to well-known hardware manufacturers, while virtual MAC addresses belong to companies that create virtualization platforms. Virtualization vendors need registered OUIs to make sure their MAC addresses remain unique and do not conflict with physical devices. This reinforces how Layer 2 addressing must stay globally coordinated. The activity helped show how MAC lookups can quickly indicate whether a device is physical or virtual.

## Upload Evidence to Your Portfolio

Include:
- Screenshot of Terminal showing your MAC address
- Screenshot of your OUI lookup results
- Your 4–5 sentence comparison from Part B
- A 2-sentence summary answering:  
  “What does my MAC address reveal about the hardware my VM is using?”

The structure and OUI of this MAC address show that the VM is using a virtual network interface assigned by virtualization software. This confirms that the VM operates on abstracted hardware managed by a hypervisor, even though the MAC address behaves like a physical one.

## Part C — Understanding MAC Address Structure

Analyze your MAC address in terms of its meaning and its role in the OSI model.

### 1. Break Down Your MAC Address
Format:
- OUI: aa:bb:cc
- Device Identifier: dd:ee:ff

### 2. Explain the OUI
Write 2–3 sentences explaining:
- What the OUI represents
- How it connects the NIC to a manufacturer
- Why OUIs must be globally unique
- If yours is virtual, why a VM still needs a vendor prefix

The OUI identifies the organization responsible for assigning MAC addresses within a specific range. It links a NIC or virtual NIC to a manufacturer or vendor authority. OUIs must be globally unique to prevent address conflicts between devices from different vendors.

### 3. Explain the Device Identifier
Write 2–3 sentences explaining:
- Why each NIC needs a unique device identifier
- Why no two devices on a LAN can share a MAC address
- How uniqueness ensures correct frame delivery

The device identifier portion of a MAC address ensures that each NIC within the same OUI range is unique. If two devices on the same network shared a MAC address, data could be sent to the wrong device. This uniqueness is essential for reliable Ethernet communication.

### 4. Compare Virtual vs Physical MAC Addresses
Write 4–6 sentences explaining:
- Where physical NICs store MAC addresses
- How virtual machines generate or assign MAC addresses
- Similarities and differences
- Why Layer 2 functions identically for physical and virtual hardware

Physical NICs store MAC addresses in non-volatile memory and often display them on a printed label. Virtual machines receive MAC addresses from the hypervisor, usually from vendor-reserved address ranges. Both use the same 48-bit format and function identically at Layer 2. The difference lies in how the address is assigned and stored. From a network’s perspective, there is no functional difference between physical and virtual MAC addresses. Switches and routers treat both the same.

### 5. MAC Addresses in the OSI Model
Write 2–3 sentences explaining:
- Which OSI layer uses MAC addresses
- Why MAC addresses never leave the local network
- How routers replace MAC addresses when forwarding frames

MAC addresses operate at the Data Link Layer, which is Layer 2 of the OSI model. These addresses stay within the local network because routers replace MAC addresses at each hop. This allows Ethernet to handle local delivery while IP handles routing across networks.
