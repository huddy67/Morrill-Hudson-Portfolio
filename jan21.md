# Task C

1. What must the attacker already know or discover?

- How to access the network
- vulnerabilities in the network

2. Which device is most directly targeted?
Choose one and explain why:
• Another end device
• A server
• The switch
• Network traffic itself

- I would say that another end device is what is most directly targeted. My reasoning for this is that devices like televisions or other smart home products rarely have software updates. Because of this, it allows for attacks to know the vulnerabilities on these devices, attack them, and access the network. The other options are also possibilities, but the easiest one would be another end device.


3. What would legitimate users likely notice (if anything)?
Be realistic — many attacks are quiet.

 - I am not sure that legitimate users would really notice anything. There could be certain signs, like the devices slowing down, or potentially thm losing access to the device, however if a professional attacker knows what they are doing, I do not think anything would be noticable. Most users do not know anything about IP addresses or networks so realistically unless they were really knowledgebale and advanced in the topic, they would not notice anything.

4. Which of your virtual machines best resembles the attacker’s perspective?
Choose one:
• Ubuntu Desktop VM
• Linux Server VM

Explain your choice based on visibility and access, not labels.

Important Rules
• Do not name specific attacks
• Do not propose fixes yet
• Do not assume perfect security
• Focus on what is possible, not what is ideal
