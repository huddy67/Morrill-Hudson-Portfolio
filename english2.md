## HOME PAGE

### WRITER’S BIO
I am a senior with a strong interest in business, problem-solving, and building ideas from the ground up. I have always been drawn to projects that allow me to take an idea and turn it into something tangible, whether that means creating a product, organizing a plan, or improving an existing system. I enjoy the process of figuring things out through trial and error and learning from what works and what does not.

My interest in business began at a young age. In seventh grade, I started my first small business by building a portable ice cream stand out of plywood and selling ice cream in my neighborhood. I designed and built the stand myself, planned where and when to sell, and interacted directly with customers. While it started as a simple project, it quickly taught me important lessons about responsibility, pricing, customer experience, and time management. That experience showed me how rewarding it can be to create something independently and motivated me to continue exploring entrepreneurial ideas.

Since then, I have remained interested in business and leadership, often applying that mindset to school projects and personal interests. I enjoy thinking about how decisions impact outcomes and how small changes can improve efficiency or effectiveness. Whether working independently or in a group, I tend to focus on organization, planning, and execution. Balancing academics with outside interests has helped me develop strong time-management skills and the ability to stay focused under pressure.

Alongside my interest in business, this course helped me grow in an area I did not expect to enjoy as much: writing and film analysis. At the beginning of the semester, I viewed writing mostly as a requirement rather than a meaningful skill. Over time, I learned that writing is a powerful way to clarify ideas and communicate complex thoughts. Through essays comparing books and their film adaptations, I became more comfortable forming arguments, supporting them with evidence, and explaining why certain choices mattered.

This class also changed the way I watch movies. I now pay closer attention to details such as camera angles, editing, pacing, tone, and performance. Learning how directors use these techniques helped me better understand how films shape audience perception. Writing about these elements pushed me to think more critically and articulate my observations clearly.

Looking ahead, I plan to major in business in college. I applied to Clemson, Virginia Tech, Tennessee, Auburn, and Penn State, and I am excited to continue developing skills related to leadership, analysis, and entrepreneurship. This course strengthened my confidence as a writer and helped me appreciate storytelling in both written and visual forms. The skills I developed this semester will be valuable in college and beyond, especially as I pursue opportunities that combine creativity, strategy, and problem-solving.

## TAB 1: WRITER’S STATEMENT
At the beginning of the semester, I viewed writing mainly as an academic requirement rather than a tool for thinking. As the course progressed, I began to see writing as a way to organize my ideas and clearly explain how books and films communicate meaning differently.

One of the biggest improvements in my writing was learning to move beyond summary. Earlier assignments focused too much on retelling the story instead of analyzing how and why certain choices were made. Writing the Wiseguy and Goodfellas essay helped me understand how techniques such as voiceover, editing, and point of view influence how the audience views a character. I learned to support my ideas with specific examples and explain why those details mattered.

Revision also became more meaningful throughout the semester. Instead of only correcting grammar, I worked on restructuring paragraphs, clarifying arguments, and improving flow. This process helped me become more confident in my writing and more willing to rethink my ideas rather than settling for a first draft.

This class also changed how I watch movies. I now pay closer attention to camera movement, lighting, tone, and acting choices. Studying films like Goodfellas showed me how directors intentionally guide the audience’s emotions and perspective.

Comparing The Princess Bride in both book and film form helped me understand that adaptation requires creative decision-making. Some elements work better on the page, while others are more effective on screen. Overall, this course helped me grow as a writer and a more thoughtful viewer, skills that will be useful beyond this class.

### PROJECT OF CHOICE SUPPORTING PARAGRAPH
For my final project, I worked with Raaj and Daniel to create a podcast analyzing the differences between a book and its film adaptation. Our goal was to discuss how the film interpreted the original text and evaluate which elements worked better on screen than on the page. Through this project, we explored how changes in structure, tone, and character portrayal affected the overall meaning of the story. The podcast allowed us to apply concepts from the course in a collaborative and creative way.
