### WRITER’S BIO
I am a senior with a strong interest in business, problem-solving, and building ideas from the ground up. I have always been drawn to projects that allow me to take an idea and turn it into something tangible, whether that means creating a product, organizing a plan, or improving an existing system. I enjoy the process of figuring things out through trial and error and learning from what works and what does not.

My interest in business began at a young age. In seventh grade, I started my first small business by building a portable ice cream stand out of plywood and selling ice cream in my neighborhood. I designed and built the stand myself, planned where and when to sell, and interacted directly with customers. While it started as a simple project, it quickly taught me important lessons about responsibility, pricing, customer experience, and time management. That experience showed me how rewarding it can be to create something independently and motivated me to continue exploring entrepreneurial ideas.

Since then, I have remained interested in business and leadership, often applying that mindset to school projects and personal interests. I enjoy thinking about how decisions impact outcomes and how small changes can improve efficiency or effectiveness. Whether working independently or in a group, I tend to focus on organization, planning, and execution. Balancing academics with outside interests has helped me develop strong time-management skills and the ability to stay focused under pressure.

Alongside my interest in business, this course helped me grow in an area I did not expect to enjoy as much: writing and film analysis. At the beginning of the semester, I viewed writing mostly as a requirement rather than a meaningful skill. Over time, I learned that writing is a powerful way to clarify ideas and communicate complex thoughts. Through essays comparing books and their film adaptations, I became more comfortable forming arguments, supporting them with evidence, and explaining why certain choices mattered.

This class also changed the way I watch movies. I now pay closer attention to details such as camera angles, editing, pacing, tone, and performance. Learning how directors use these techniques helped me better understand how films shape audience perception. Writing about these elements pushed me to think more critically and articulate my observations clearly.

Looking ahead, I plan to major in business in college. I applied to Clemson, Virginia Tech, Tennessee, Auburn, and Penn State, and I am excited to continue developing skills related to leadership, analysis, and entrepreneurship. This course strengthened my confidence as a writer and helped me appreciate storytelling in both written and visual forms. The skills I developed this semester will be valuable in college and beyond, especially as I pursue opportunities that combine creativity, strategy, and problem-solving.

## TAB 1: WRITER’S STATEMENT

This course pushed me to think more carefully about how stories are constructed and how meaning changes depending on the medium. Rather than focusing only on what happens in a story, my writing this semester began to focus on how choices made by authors and filmmakers influence the audience’s understanding of characters, themes, and tone.

One of the most important skills I developed was learning how to narrow my focus. Instead of trying to cover every part of a book or film, I learned to select specific moments and analyze them in depth. In the Wiseguy and Goodfellas essay, this meant focusing on techniques like voiceover, editing, and pacing to explain how the audience is positioned to sympathize with Henry Hill. By concentrating on a few key examples, my arguments became clearer and more convincing.

Another area of growth was learning how to connect evidence to interpretation. I became more intentional about explaining why a quote, scene, or film technique mattered rather than assuming the significance was obvious. This helped my writing feel more analytical and less descriptive. It also forced me to slow down and think through my ideas before putting them on the page.

Revision played a major role in improving my work. Instead of viewing revision as simple correction, I used it as a way to refine my ideas and improve clarity. Rearranging paragraphs, cutting unnecessary explanation, and tightening language helped me communicate more effectively. This process made my writing more focused and easier to follow.

This class also changed the way I engage with films outside of assignments. I now watch movies with greater attention to visual details such as framing, lighting, sound, and performance. Studying adaptations like The Princess Bride showed me how translating a story from page to screen requires creative decisions that shape the audience’s experience in new ways.

Overall, this course strengthened my ability to analyze storytelling across different formats. I leave the class with a better understanding of how narrative choices work and greater confidence in my ability to explain those choices clearly in writing.

### PROJECT OF CHOICE SUPPORTING PARAGRAPH
For my final project, I worked with Raaj and Daniel to create a podcast analyzing the differences between a book and its film adaptation. Our goal was to discuss how the film interpreted the original text and evaluate which elements worked better on screen than on the page. Through this project, we explored how changes in structure, tone, and character portrayal affected the overall meaning of the story. The podcast allowed us to apply concepts from the course in a collaborative and creative way.
