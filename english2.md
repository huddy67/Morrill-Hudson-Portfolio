### WRITER’S BIO
I am a senior with a strong interest in business, problem-solving, and building ideas from the ground up. I have always been drawn to projects that allow me to take an idea and turn it into something tangible, whether that means creating a product, organizing a plan, or improving an existing system. I enjoy the process of figuring things out through trial and error and learning from what works and what does not.

My interest in business began at a young age. In seventh grade, I started my first small business by building a portable ice cream stand out of plywood and selling ice cream in my neighborhood. I designed and built the stand myself, planned where and when to sell, and interacted directly with customers. While it started as a simple project, it quickly taught me important lessons about responsibility, pricing, customer experience, and time management. That experience showed me how rewarding it can be to create something independently and motivated me to continue exploring entrepreneurial ideas.

Since then, I have remained interested in business and leadership, often applying that mindset to school projects and personal interests. I enjoy thinking about how decisions impact outcomes and how small changes can improve efficiency or effectiveness. Whether working independently or in a group, I tend to focus on organization, planning, and execution. Balancing academics with outside interests has helped me develop strong time-management skills and the ability to stay focused under pressure.

Alongside my interest in business, this course helped me grow in an area I did not expect to enjoy as much: writing and film analysis. At the beginning of the semester, I viewed writing mostly as a requirement rather than a meaningful skill. Over time, I learned that writing is a powerful way to clarify ideas and communicate complex thoughts. Through essays comparing books and their film adaptations, I became more comfortable forming arguments, supporting them with evidence, and explaining why certain choices mattered.

This class also changed the way I watch movies. I now pay closer attention to details such as camera angles, editing, pacing, tone, and performance. Learning how directors use these techniques helped me better understand how films shape audience perception. Writing about these elements pushed me to think more critically and articulate my observations clearly.

Looking ahead, I plan to major in business in college. I applied to Clemson, Virginia Tech, Tennessee, Auburn, and Penn State, and I am excited to continue developing skills related to leadership, analysis, and entrepreneurship. This course strengthened my confidence as a writer and helped me appreciate storytelling in both written and visual forms. The skills I developed this semester will be valuable in college and beyond, especially as I pursue opportunities that combine creativity, strategy, and problem-solving.

## TAB 1: WRITER’S STATEMENT

My approach to writing analysis developed significantly over the course of this semester, both in how I organize my thinking and how I engage with texts and films. At the beginning of the class, my process was mostly informal. I would read or watch something, form a general opinion, and then try to explain it afterward. As the semester progressed, I learned that effective analysis requires intention before writing even begins. I started approaching assignments by identifying a clear focus, choosing specific scenes or moments, and deciding what I wanted to argue before drafting. This shift in process helped my writing become more controlled and purposeful.

One of the biggest changes in my writing came from learning how to balance evidence and interpretation. Earlier in the semester, my writing leaned heavily toward explanation and description. I often assumed that the significance of a scene or quote would be obvious to the reader. Through feedback and revision, I learned that strong analysis depends on clearly explaining why a detail matters and how it supports a larger claim. This was especially clear in my Wiseguy and Goodfellas essay. Instead of summarizing Henry Hill’s story, I focused on how Scorsese’s use of voiceover, editing, and camera movement encourages the audience to feel connected to Henry while still exposing his moral flaws. Narrowing my focus allowed me to go deeper and make a more convincing argument.

Revision also became a much more meaningful part of my process. Rather than treating revision as a final step to fix grammar or wording, I began using it to reshape my ideas. I reorganized paragraphs, removed unnecessary explanations, and clarified my claims. Revising my Goodfellas essay helped me see that writing is not just about getting ideas down once, but about refining them through multiple drafts. This process taught me patience and made me more confident in my ability to improve my work through effort and reflection.

Studying film alongside literature had a major impact on how I write and how I watch movies. Before this class, I enjoyed movies but did not think critically about how they were constructed. Learning film terms such as mise-en-scène, pacing, framing, and editing gave me a vocabulary to explain what I was noticing. Instead of saying that a scene “felt intense” or “worked well,” I could identify the specific techniques that created that effect. For example, analyzing Goodfellas helped me understand how fast-paced editing and continuous camera movement mirror Henry Hill’s lifestyle and mindset. This understanding made my writing more precise and helped me see films as carefully constructed works rather than just entertainment.

Comparing The Princess Bride in both book and film form further changed how I think about storytelling. Goldman’s novel uses metafiction to constantly remind the reader that the story is being shaped and edited, while Reiner’s film uses the framing device of the grandfather and grandson to achieve a similar effect visually. Writing about these choices showed me that adaptation is not about copying a story exactly, but about translating it into a new medium. Considering historical context, audience expectations, and genre conventions helped me better understand why certain changes were made and how they affect meaning.

This course taught me to watch more actively. I now pay attention to how directors make intentional decisions based on theme, historical context, and audience. I am more aware of how films reflect the time period in which they were made and how those influences shape tone and perspective. This awareness will stay with me beyond this class and change how I engage with films in the future.

Overall, this course helped me grow as a writer by teaching me how to think more critically, write with intention, and revise with purpose. It also helped me see myself as someone capable of thoughtful analysis rather than just a summary. The combination of literature and film challenged me to explain complex ideas clearly, and that growth has been one of the most valuable outcomes of the semester.

### PROJECT OF CHOICE SUPPORTING PARAGRAPH
For my final project, I worked with Raaj and Daniel to create a podcast analyzing the differences between a book and its film adaptation. Our goal was to discuss how the film interpreted the original text and evaluate which elements worked better on screen than on the page. Through this project, we explored how changes in structure, tone, and character portrayal affected the overall meaning of the story. The podcast allowed us to apply concepts from the course creatively.
