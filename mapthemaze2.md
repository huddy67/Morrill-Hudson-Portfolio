# Project Introduction
This was our second project of the year. In this project, we worked primarily in the linux terminal going through various activites to help us understand the basics of coding. We learned the following commands, which were needed as prior knowledge during the activities.

### Commands

| Command | What It Does / Example |
|---------|-------------------------|
| **pwd** | **Stands for:** print working directory <br> **Does:** shows the full path of the folder you are currently “inside” in terminal <br> **Angle:** helps you always know “where you are” in your file system |
| **ls**  | **Stands for:** list <br> **Does:** lists the files and subfolders in the current directory <br> **Extra options:** <br> • `ls -l` → long listing (permissions, size, dates) <br> • `ls -a` → shows hidden files |
| **cd**  | **Stands for:** change directory <br> **Does:** moves you from your current folder into another folder <br> **Special cases:** <br> • `cd ..` → go up one level (to parent folder) <br> • `cd ~` → go to your home directory <br> **Angle:** like double clicking a folder in Finder <br> **Example:** `cd documents` |
| **mkdir** | **Stands for:** make directory <br> **Does:** creates new folder <br> **Angle:** equivalent to right click → new folder in Finder <br> **Example:** `mkdir projects` |
| **touch** | **Stands for:** no acronym, but it “touches” a file <br> **Does:** creates a new empty file or updates an existing one <br> **Angle:** often used to quickly create a blank file |
| **cp** | **Stands for:** copy <br> **Does:** makes a duplicate of a file <br> **Syntax:** `cp [source] [destination]` <br> **Angle:** difference between copying (duplicate stays in both places) and moving <br> **Example:** `cp notes.txt backup.txt` |
| **mv** | **Stands for:** move <br> **Does:** moves a file from one location to another or renames a file <br> **Examples:** <br> • `mv notes.txt documents/` <br> • `mv notes.txt notes_old.txt` |
| **open** | **Stands for:** open <br> **Does:** opens a file or folder using the default macOS app (like double clicking in Finder) <br> **Options:** <br> • `open .` → opens the current folder in Finder <br> • `open -a "AppName" file` → opens with specific app <br> **Angle:** CLI connects back to GUI apps |
| **rm** | **Stands for:** remove <br> **Does:** deletes a file permanently (does not go to trash) <br> **Extra options:** <br> • `rm -r foldername` → removes a folder and everything inside it <br> **Angle:** BIG caution here – danger. There's no “undo” or trash safety net <br> **Example:** `rm notes.txt` |
