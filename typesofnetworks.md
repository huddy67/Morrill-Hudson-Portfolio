1. Are your internal and external IP addresses the same or different? Different
2. Which IP belongs to your local network? The one from the ubuntu vm
3. Which IP belongs to the internet? the one from the website
4. Why might a virtual machine use Network Address Translation (NAT) when  connecting to the internet? A virtual machine might use NAT when connecting to the internet because it provides another layer of security by hiding the VM's internal IP address and also help simplify setup because multiple VM's can use the same IP address.
5. How does Shared mode make it easier to connect multiple virtual machines on one  computer? Shared mode makes this easier because it allows them to share the host computers network connection without needing to have a different IP address for each one.

Step 4: Reflection Questions (Bridged Mode) 
Answer the following in complete sentences in a well-written paragraph on your digital  portfolio: 
1. How did your internal IP address change when you switched to Bridged mode? 2. Did your external IP address change or remain the same? 
3. In Bridged mode, does your virtual machine act more like a separate computer or a  computer behind another device? 
4. Why might an organization choose Bridged mode instead of Shared (NAT) mode? 5. What security or management challenges could come with using Bridged mode? 

(insert table)

Write a short paragraph (5–7 sentences) beneath your table addressing the following:
• Which mode made your VM appear as its own device on the local network?
• Which mode provided a safer, more controlled environment?
• How does NAT help manage limited IPv4 addresses and improve security?
• What did you learn about how data travels from a device to the internet?

Part 4: Digital Portfolio Reflection
Step 1: Add Screenshots
Take screenshots of the following and insert them into your digital portfolio:
• The output of ip a in Shared (NAT) mode
• The output of ip a in Bridged mode
• The WhatIsMyIPAddress.com page results for both modes

insert screenshots

Step 2: Reflection Writing
Write a short reflection (1 paragraph, 5–8 sentences) below your screenshots that answers these:
• How did your IP addresses change between Shared and Bridged mode?
• What did this experiment teach you about how local and public networks communicate?
• Why might IT professionals use different network configurations for home, business, or
lab environments?
• Which mode do you think is best for classroom use, and why?
