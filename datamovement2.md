## Planning and Design

### Objectives

The objective of the LAN components document was to use commands such as ifconfig, ping, and traceroute in Ubuntu. This was focused on identifying network interfaces, testing connections, and analyzing data paths to understand how devices communicate within a network. The second document titled "binary_denary" was a walk-through of how to convert numbers between binary and denary systems. The goal was to understand how to interpret these numbers using base 2 and base 10 values, explain how these conversions relate to IP addresses/network data, and use ubuntu commands to check and manipulate network numbers in real time. 

### Classwork Evidence

Below are pictures of class activities relating to these documents and their objectives.

## Technical Development 

LAN Components lab

  - This lab focused on using the following commands
      - ifcongfig
      - ping
      - traceroute

Binary/Denary Lab

- The objectives were listed above, but in short, convert binary and denary, and understand how to do and check this in Ubuntu.

## Testing and Evaluation

Ping results: Ping shows the response time (latency) between the computer and server, measured in milliseconds. The lower the time, the faster the connection is.

Traceroute results: Traceroute displays each hop or router that data passes through to get to its destination. This allows for analysis of where delays occur along the network path.

Netstat Results: Netstat lists the active network connections, which show local and remote addresses, ports, and connection states, which can help identify potential network issues.
